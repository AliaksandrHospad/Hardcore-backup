She's just a girl and she's on fire
Hotter than a fantasy, lonely like a highway
She's living in a world and it's on fire
Filled with catastrophe, but she knows she can fly away
Raindrops falling from heaven
Could never take away my misery
Since we're not together
I'll wait for stormy weather
To hide these tears I hope you'll never see
